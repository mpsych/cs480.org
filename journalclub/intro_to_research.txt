# Intro to Research

## Research in Industry vs. Research in Academia
* research positions seem to be more flexible in terms of job duties/projects, hours, and dresscode
* much more money in industry

## Publications
* Venues: Journals, Conferences 
** Top Conferences: CVPR, ICML, NeurIPS, ICCV, SigKDD, MICCAI ... (general), but there might be more domain-specific venues (IEEE Visualization, ) (accpetance rate ~20%)
** Top Journals: Nature, Science..
* Peer Review
** other researchers judge your work (2-4)
* pre-prints on ArXiv
* Publishers get all the money!
* Overleaf/Latex are the best way of writing papers

## Citations
* show how impactful your research is
* h-index: X number of papers cited X times.. h-index 13: I have 13 papers cited at least 13 times
* Google Scholar: researcher profiles, search engine for scientific research
* BibTex (from LaTeX) allows easy citations, Google Scholar has the "CITE" button but also the publishers have cite buttons

## Research in Academia: The Tenure-Track
* if you get tenured, you have the position for life
* protection of faculty
* usually 6 years
** you start as an Assistant Professor
** become an Associate Professor
** after Associate (another 5 years), you become Full Professor
* Research, Teaching, Service (Research is what counts most)
* Annual Faculty Report
* UMass salaries: http://cthrupayroll.mass.gov/

## Grants fund your research
* Funding Agencies
** National Science Foundation (success rate ~20%, Future of Work 5%)
** National Institutes of Health: Co-PI ~$150,000 (I only applied for $100k, UMass Boston charges overhead %52.5)
** Massachusetts Life Sciences Center $750,000 for equipment (UMB overhead 0%)
* many other institutes offer funding opportunity, private donors Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative... 
** 52.5% sounds like a lot of overhead, Harvard Univerity charges 70%
* to apply for funding: you need multi-page proposals, detailed budgets etc.
* up to 10 people (peer scientists) decide whether your proposal gets funded
